# Shared Mobility Domain Model

This project includes a domain model that enables the modeling of shared mobility systems,
focusing on various information security objectives.
Furthermore, we provide a model transformation into a specialized target model for analysis.
This target model is an instantiation of the DataFlowDiagram-Metamodel [^DFD-Metamodel],
so we can now use Data Flow Analysis [^DataFlowAnalysis] extensions
to examine the impact on confidentiality caused by architectural uncertainties [^ABUNAI]
or assess data privacy compliance [^MDPA].
